Transforming Lending: Leveraging Machine Learning for Objective Loan Assessment
Loan Approval Prediction
Abstract
This project uses various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, and XGBoost to predict loan status. This contrasts with traditional subjective assessment methods. Machine learning is excellent at analyzing extensive datasets, which ensures higher accuracy and transparency while mitigating biases that are inherent in manual assessments. It also speeds up the loan processing, enhancing operational efficiency, unlike traditional methods that are prone to biases, prolonged processing, and limited scalability. This project aims to introduce a more objective, efficient, and fair lending framework by leveraging machine learning.
